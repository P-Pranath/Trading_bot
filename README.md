# Trading_bot
Fully automated intraday trading bot for Indian stock markets using Fyers API, built with Python and real-time NSE data.

This is my custom 'Trading Agent', specifically developed to work with the Zerodha trading platform. You can find the code files in this repository.

We have a file named Generator, which is used to obtain the secret key and access token.
Note: You need a valid Zerodha API key to use the Generator file.

Once you have all the required keys, please assign them to the respective variables. I've created a stub named parameters â€” search for "Your_api_key" and replace it with your actual key.

The parameters file contains all the parameters used for trading. You can refer to it to make adjustments in the code.

Lastly, we have the requirements file, which lists all the necessary packages. Running this will install everything needed.

Happy trading!
